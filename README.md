Oh man, where even to begin? Just got out of Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare — I'm sitting here, feet still kind of sticking to the popcorn-and-soda carpet, and my back is just screaming from those theater seats. Like, seriously, why do they make them out of concrete?

Did you ever feel like a   gobbles you up and spits you out like chewed bubblegum? The kind that’s lost the flavor but you’re still chewing anyway? That was this. Captain Hook was a total fever dream. Imagine Alice Cooper missing breakfast and diving headfirst into a 4-day nightmare vegan bender. He was SO over the top but also somehow... was he the hero? I dunno, I'm still lost.

> The sound system was almost ready to blast my eardrums into Neverland itself. I kept thinking, is this the soundtrack or an actual earthquake? Tinkerbell's wings sounded like the world's largest bee was having an existential crisis. But damn, the visuals, like if Van Gogh just drank 20 cups of espresso then scribbled with crayons.

Dude, I swore I saw a donut flying around at the point Peter tried to juggle those flaming swords — all very metaphorical, probably? Or maybe it was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 Will's chaotic brain. Wendy had that moment with the shadow – goosebumps, literal goosebumps, like when you realize your socks are mismatched after you leave the house, but in a good way!

Someone asked me if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and honestly? I'm 50% sure you should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   just to unravel if tiger lilies can actually throw better shade than a grumpy cat. Or maybe just for that scene where the crocodile tap dances on a moonslit puddle!?

Ok gotta pause and breathe, I legit didn't realize I was holding my breath half the time. And then they blended Edward Scissorhands' fashion sense into the Lost Boys attire, and man, can you feel itchy just by 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨? I swear I felt imaginary seams against my skin the whole runtime.
